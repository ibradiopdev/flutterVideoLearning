# Flutter Navigation Exercise

This repository contains one of my exercises to become more familiar with Flutter development concepts. In this application, I explore navigation using the `BottomNavigationBar` to switch between different types of pages.

As the saying goes, "everything is a widget," so I've used `StatelessWidget` for the overall interface of the pages and `StatefulWidget` to manage the state changes when pressing the navigation buttons: HOME, PROFILE, SETTINGS.

I've created a list of pages that I traverse with the `_selectedIndex` variable. When navigating, the page to display is determined by this variable, whose state is automatically managed by the `setState()` method within the `StatefulWidget`. This makes navigation smoother without the need to reload the entire application with each navigation.

The design is minimalist, and the colors are chosen randomly. The primary goal of this exercise is to become proficient in navigating between different pages.

Flutter is an easy-to-grasp framework, although it might be a bit challenging at first. However, with a lot of enjoyment and passion, I continue to learn and explore its capabilities.

**KEEP GOING!**
